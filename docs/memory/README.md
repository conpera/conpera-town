# Project memory — conpera-town

Reusable lessons, patterns, decisions, pitfalls for **this repo**, beside the code.
Read automatically: the conpera memory-recall hook injects the most relevant at the
top of every prompt run in this repo; the nightly sleep-cycle harvests cross-cutting
ones to the global store.

## Capture (agents: the moment you learn something reusable, write it)

`docs/memory/<type>-<NNN>-<slug>.md`, types: `pat` pattern · `lrn` lesson ·
`dec` decision · `pit` pitfall · `cmd` verified-command. Frontmatter:

```yaml
